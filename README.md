Tutorial repository SNHU
Hello, you have found the tutorial repository for my work at SNHU. 
My name is Valerie Smith and I am a computer science student and a full time web developer.
My favorite code to write in is Java, and I also like to work with client facing website technologies such as ReactJS 
and regular Javascript. 
Thank you for reading :)
